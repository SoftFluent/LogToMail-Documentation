# Testing and runnings your rules

LogToMail can run as a Windows service or a console application, making it easy for you to test your own rules before publishing it to production.

Obviously, LogToMail needs the rights to access the Windows events logs. If it does not run as admin, it needs the **SeSecurityPrivilege** rights.
